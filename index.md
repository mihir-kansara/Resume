## About Me <a name="about"></a>
As a Business Manager at Capital One, I collaborate with the Fraud - Customer Experience & Strategy team to develop and implement data-driven solutions that enhance customer satisfaction and reduce fraud losses. I leverage my skills in analytics, strategy, and presentations to deliver insights and recommendations that support business decisions and initiatives.

I have a Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering from Columbia University, where I gained exposure to various tools and techniques in data science, machine learning, and natural language processing. Prior to joining Capital One, I worked as a Trading Services Analyst at J.P Morgan, where I automated 30+ processes for trade support and regulatory teams, saving over 300 hours per month. I also interned at Hexanika, where I built and integrated machine learning codes to automate fintech problems and handle big data efficiently. I am passionate about creating a difference in the world through data and technology.
