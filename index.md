## About Me <a name="about"></a>
As a Business Manager at Capital One, I collaborate with the Fraud - Customer Experience & Strategy team to develop and implement data-driven solutions that enhance customer satisfaction and reduce fraud losses. I leverage my skills in analytics, strategy, and presentations to deliver insights and recommendations that support business decisions and initiatives.

I hold a Master of Science in Industrial Engineering from Columbia University, where I gained expertise in data science, machine learning, and natural language processing. My career began at J.P. Morgan as a Trading Services Analyst, where I automated over 30 processes for trade support, saving 300+ hours monthly. During my internship at Hexanika, I developed machine learning algorithms to solve complex fintech problems efficiently. I'm driven to make a positive impact through data and technology.
